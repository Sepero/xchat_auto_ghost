XChat Auto Ghost
================

XChat Automatic Ghost Python Plugin

After signing onto an irc server, this plugin will check to see if you are logged in
using your first nick name of choice. If not, it will attempt to ghost the nick name, switch
to that name, and identify as that user.

Instructions for installing this plugin should be found on this page.

I am not well experienced in writing xchat plugins, and the hook method used in this plugin
may be improved upon. Any suggestions, comments, forks, or emails are appreciated.
